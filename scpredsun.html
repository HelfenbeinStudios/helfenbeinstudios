<p>SCP: Red Sun is a horror survival game based on the SCP Foundation wiki. It is inspired by the story of SCP-001, <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shaggydredlocks-proposal">"When Day Breaks"</a>
, by S. D. Locke.</p>
<p>Included in the game are three gamemodes: Story Mode, Security Mode, and Class-D Mode.</p>
<h3>STORY MODE</h3>
<p>Follow the main character through hordes of wax zombies and into an SCP Foundation site, where there's been a breach in containment. Who knows who, or what, you will find?</p>
<h3>SECURITY MODE</h3>
<p>Monitor security cameras of the SCP Foundation site in the security room. SCP-001 has caused many deaths, leading to the lack of security in the facility. Strategically open and close doors to keep SCPs away from getting to you.</p>
<h3>CLASS-D MODE</h3>
<p>SCP-001 has caused a lack of security. SCP containments have opened, and you have to survive. Explore the facility, and try to find survivors.</p>
<h3>COMING SOON</h3>
